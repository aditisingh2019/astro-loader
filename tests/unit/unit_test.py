"""
Test suite for the Data Ingestion Subsystem.

Structure:
- unit/: fast tests for individual components (validation, cleaning).

Important Behavior:
- Unit tests should not require a running database.
- Tests should cover both happy paths and failure scenarios.
- Code coverage should prioritize logic, not boilerplate.
