Test suite for the Data Ingestion Subsystem.

Structure:
- integration/: tests that interact with PostgreSQL.

Important Behavior:
- Integration tests should validate end-to-end correctness.
- Tests should cover both happy paths and failure scenarios.
- Code coverage should prioritize logic, not boilerplate.
